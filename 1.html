  <h2><u><a href="https://namu.wiki/w/에일리" target="_blank" title="ailee profile">Ailee</a> to leave agency The L1ve at end of July - 새 기획사를 찾아서 </u></h2s>
  <p>Singer Ailee is leaving her agency The L1ve, founded by boy band VIXX Ravi,
  a year since joining the label.
  The L1ve announced Friday that Ailee contract will be terminated at the end of July.
  <strong>We express our gratitude to Ailee, who has always shown her best on stage while with The L1ve, the agency said. Even though our contract ends here, we will always support her.</strong>
  Ravi established The L1ve in July last year, aiming to support artists from a wide range of music genres. This sets The L1ve apart from Ravi other label, Groovl1n, which focuses on hip-hop and R&B artists.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:30px;">Ailee was the first artist to sign under The L1ve. The agency also currently represents singer Wheein of Mamamoo.
  Ailee debuted in 2012 with her digital single Heaven, which quickly became a hit.
  She is known for her powerful vocals and songs I Will Show You (2012) and I Will Go to You Like the First Snow (2017). The latter was featured on the soundtrack of popular television series Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (2016-17) on tvN.</p>
