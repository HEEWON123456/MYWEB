    Wolverhampton Wanderers is filing a formal complain to UEFA after a player — believed to be Korean forward Hwang Hee-chan — was the target of racist abuse from fans of Portuguese side Farense during a friendly at Estádio Algarve in the Algarve, Portugal on Sunday.
    Wolves issued a statement later on Sunday saying the club is filing a complaint because of the abuse, but did not name the player that was the target.
    We are very disappointed to report that one of our players was the target of discriminatory abuse from opposition fans this evening game with SC Farense,the statement said. "We will be reporting the incident to UEFA and asking our opponent and relevant authorities to investigate. We are offering our full support to the player involved.
